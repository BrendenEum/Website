abstract: "A growing body of research has shown that simple choices involve the
  construction and comparison of values at the time of decision. These processes
  are modulated by attention in a way that leaves decision makers susceptible to
  attentional biases. Here we study the role of peripheral visual information on
  the choice process and on attentional choice biases. We use an eye-tracking
  experiment where subjects make binary choices between food items that are
  displayed in marked screen “shelves” in two conditions: (1) where both items
  are displayed, and (2) where items are only displayed when subjects fixate
  within their shelves. We find that removing the nonfixated option
  approximately doubles the size of the attentional biases. The results show
  that peripheral visual information is crucial in facilitating good decisions,
  and suggest that individuals might be influenceable by settings in which only
  one item is shown at a time, such as e-commerce."
