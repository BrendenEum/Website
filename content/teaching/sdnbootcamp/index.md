The SDN bootcamp is meant to prepare incoming PhD students for the courses they will encounter in their first two years of graduate school. I taught both the economics and statistics portions of the bootcamp. My course was split into three sections: (1) intermediate microeconomics; (2) behavioral economics and neuroeconomics; and (3) introductory statistics, econometrics, and Bayesian statistics.
