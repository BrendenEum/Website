Summer 2023

"The Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships (SURF) program is one of the 'crown jewels' of Caltech. Since 1979, SURF students have had the opportunity to conduct research under the guidance of experienced mentors working at the frontier of their fields."

Role
======
Co-Mentor with Antonio Rangel

Tasks
======
This particular SURF student was tasked with testing the assumption in the Drift-Diffusion-Model (DDM) that early and late information contribute equally to the evidence accumulation process. My job was to (1) guide them through the research process, (2) help them understand the theory or concepts related to their research project, (3) resolve any issues they had with programming in R and Python, and (4) fit variations of the DDM to their experimental data.
