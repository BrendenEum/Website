"Caltech's WAVE Fellows program aims to foster diversity by increasing the participation of underrepresented students in science and engineering Ph.D. programs and making Caltech's programs more visible and accessible to students not traditionally exposed to Caltech. WAVE Fellows will have the opportunity to conduct research under the guidance of Caltech faculty working at the frontier of their fields."

Role

Co-Mentor with Antonio Rangel

Tasks

This particular WAVE Fellow was tasked with exploring the variance of value signals in an experiment as subjects were repeatedly exposed to the same stimuli. My job was to (1) guide them through the research process, (2) help them understand the theory or concepts related to their research project, and (3) resolve any issues they had with programming in R.
