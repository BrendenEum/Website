Yujia and I hiked the Mt. San Antonio and Mt. Baldy Notch Trail, which is a 9.6 mile loop to the summit of Mt. Baldy and back. We took the East to West route with 3,943 feet of elevation gain.

It starts off pretty easy, slowly ascending the side of a hill to a ski cabin. After the cabin, the trail steepens and the hiking becomes harder. Eventually, we reached the Devil's Backbone trail, which really looked how it sounds. This took us to the summit of Mt. Baldy, where the bone-chilling wind quickly sent us on our way down. The descent was especially steep, but had plenty of places to rest and camp.
