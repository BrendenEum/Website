I don't have too much to say about this trip. Due to injuries or work, it had been a while since Kai, Cindy, or I had climbed. We decided to get back into it by climbing Ending Crack (T 5.7 PG13) at The Black Wall in Ojai. We made a quick day trip up to the crag, which luckily stays in the shade for most of the day.

Overall, the climbing wasn't very challenging, but we did climb the most prominent line at the crag. Cindy cruised the line, which was a surprise. Looks like she's shaping into a decent crack climber!
