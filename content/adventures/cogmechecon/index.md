I was accepted to attend the Summer School on the Cognitive Mechanisms of Economic Behavior in Vitznau, Switzerland! It was a fantastic time, filled with great talks, interesting people, and lots of cherry tomatoes. We stayed at the Flora Alpina on the southern end of Lake Lucerne. We spent some time in the nearby towns, swimming in the lake, hiking up one of the mountains in the Alps (Rigi something), and visiting some local museums.
