I am a PhD candidate in Social & Decision Neuroscience at Caltech and a member of the Rangel Neuroeconomics Lab. I utilize tools from economics, neuroscience, and psychology to study how attention, perception, and context affect human decision-making. Prior to coming to Caltech, I earned my MA in Economics from Columbia University and completed a predoctoral fellowship at the Columbia Business School Economics Division. Outside of academics, I am an avid rock climber, snowboarder, and energy expenditure enthusiast.
