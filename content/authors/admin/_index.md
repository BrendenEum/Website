Hello! I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Marketing Department at Rotman School of Management, working with [Ryan Webb](http://ryan-webb.com/).

I use tools from neuroscience, psychology, and economics to explore how attention, context, and perception shape consumer decision-making, with a recent focus on leveraging response time metrics to analyze market dynamics and enhance demand estimation.

I recently received my [Ph.D. in Social and Decision Neuroscience](https://www.hss.caltech.edu/graduate-studies/social-and-decision-neuroscience-phd-program) from Caltech, where I was advised by [Antonio Rangel](https://www.rnl.caltech.edu/) and supported by the [Chen Graduate Research Fellowship](https://neuroscience.caltech.edu/people/chen-graduate-fellows/2019-2020). Before that, I was as a [predoctoral fellow at Columbia Business School](https://business.columbia.edu/research-resources/research-opportunities/predoctoral-staff-associates) (Economics Division) for two years and earned an M.A. in Economics from Columbia University.

Beyond research, I'm an avid rock climber and also enjoy backpacking, snowboarding, and cycling.
