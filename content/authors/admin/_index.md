Hello! I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in Marketing with [Dr. Ryan Webb](http://ryan-webb.com/) at the Rotman School of Management.

I utilize tools from economics, neuroscience, and psychology to study how attention, context, and perception affect consumer judgement and decision-making, with a recent focus on using attention and response time metrics to study market dynamics and improve demand estimation.

I recently received my [Ph.D. in Social and Decision Neuroscience](https://www.hss.caltech.edu/graduate-studies/social-and-decision-neuroscience-phd-program) from Caltech, where I was advised by [Antonio Rangel](https://www.rnl.caltech.edu/) and supported by the [Chen Graduate Research Fellowship](https://neuroscience.caltech.edu/people/chen-graduate-fellows/2019-2020). Before that, I spent 2 years as a [predoctoral fellow at Columbia Business School](https://business.columbia.edu/research-resources/research-opportunities/predoctoral-staff-associates) (Economics Division) and received an M.A. in Economics from Columbia University.

Outside of research, I am obsessed with rock climbing and also enjoy backpacking, snowboarding, and cycling.
