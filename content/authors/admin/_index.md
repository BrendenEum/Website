I am a PhD candidate in Social & Decision Neuroscience at Caltech and a member of the Rangel Neuroeconomics Lab. I utilize tools from cognitive neuroscience, economics, and computational psychology to study how attention and context affect human decision-making. Prior to coming to Caltech, I earned my MA in Economics from Columbia University and served as the Joint Micro and Macroeconomics Research Associate at the Columbia Business School. Outside of academics, I am an avid rock climber, snowboarder, and hiker.
