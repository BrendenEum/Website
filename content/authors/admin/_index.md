Hello! I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Marketing Department at the Rotman School of Management, working with [Ryan Webb](http://ryan-webb.com/).

My research focuses on **brains in markets**: how the choice process shapes both individual choices and aggregate market outcomes. At the market level, I apply insights from neuroscience to distinct contexts, including the role of decision speed in price convergence, the use of neural data for demand forecasting, and the optimization of matching markets via decision time. At the individual level, I focus on how attention to aversive stimuli influences choice.

I recently received my [Ph.D. in Social and Decision Neuroscience](https://www.hss.caltech.edu/graduate-studies/social-and-decision-neuroscience-phd-program) from Caltech, where I was advised by [Antonio Rangel](https://www.rnl.caltech.edu/) and supported by the [Chen Graduate Research Fellowship](https://neuroscience.caltech.edu/people/chen-graduate-fellows/2019-2020). Before that, I was as a [predoctoral fellow at Columbia Business School](https://business.columbia.edu/research-resources/research-opportunities/predoctoral-staff-associates) (Economics Division) for two years and earned an M.A. in Economics from Columbia University.

Beyond research, I'm an avid rock climber and also enjoy backpacking, running, and music production.
