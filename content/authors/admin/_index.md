Hello! I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in Marketing at the University of Toronto, Rotman School of Management.

I utilize tools from economics, neuroscience, and psychology to study how attention, context, and perception affect consumer judgement and decision-making, with a recent focus using attention and response time metrics to improve demand estimation and design more efficient markets.

I recently received my Ph.D. in Social and Decision Neuroscience from Caltech, where I was advised by Antonio Rangel and supported by the Chen Graduate Research Fellowship. Before that, I spent 2 years as a predoctoral fellow at Columbia Business School (Economics Division) and received an M.A. in Economics from Columbia University.

Outside of research, I am obsessed with rock climbing and also enjoy backpacking, snowboarding, and cycling.
