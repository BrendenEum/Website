summary: This project seeks to introduce an additional metric for evaluating
  sequential sampling models by tracking the evolution of beliefs throughout a
  decision. In order to elicit continuous reporting of beliefs throughout a
  single decision process, we built a physical slider device that enables
  low-effort, intuitive, and continuous reporting. We combine a psychophysical
  task (Tsetsos et al., 2016) with an incentive-compatible belief reporting
  mechanism (Holt and Smith, 2009) to elicit truthful reporting in a task that
  requires accumulation of information. We then compare the observed evolution
  of beliefs with simulated belief paths to determine which sequential sampling
  model most closely resembles the choice process.
