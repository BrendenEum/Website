slides: Attentional biases in gains, attentional anomalies in losses
url_pdf: ""
summary: Here we test a simple yet unstudied prediction of the Attentional Drift-Diffusion-Model (aDDM). In the gain-domain, visual attention to a fixated lottery results in attentional discounting of the nonfixated lottery. However in the loss-domain, the aDDM predicts that visual attention to a fixated lottery should instead result in attentional amplication of the nonfixated lottery. We use a binary choice task between two lotteries with eye-tracking to determine if attentional discounting in the gain-domain indeed flips to attentional amplification in the loss-domain.
