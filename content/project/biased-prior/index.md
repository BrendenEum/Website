summary: There are many sequential sampling models that trace the process of numerosity perception. With endogenous response times, they predict similar patterns in behavior, making them difficult to distinguish. We use a numerosity task where we present subjects with 100 blue and red dots in a cluster and ask them to determine if there is more blue than red, or vice versa. Crucially, we induce biased priors and exogenous reponse times. This conditionally affects the predictability of subjects' choices depending on the exogenous response time. However, the pattern of predictability differs between the Bayesian efficient coding hypothesis and other models, such as Cheyette and Piantadosi (2020). Even within Bayesian efficient coding, this pattern differs depending on how agents best respond to their posterior beliefs (e.g. sampling versus maximum a posteriori estimate). We hope to tease apart the different models and provide deeper insight into the process behind numerosity perception.

There are many sequential sampling models that trace the process of numerosity perception. With endogenous response times, they predict similar patterns in behavior, making them difficult to distinguish. We use a numerosity task where we present subjects with 100 blue and red dots in a cluster and ask them to determine if there is more blue than red, or vice versa. Crucially, we induce biased priors and exogenous reponse times. This conditionally affects the predictability of subjects' choices depending on the exogenous response time.
