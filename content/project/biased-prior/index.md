slides: Comparing sequential sampling models using biased priors
url_pdf: ""
summary: There are many sequential sampling models that describe choices in the numerosity and perception domains. With endogenous response times, they predict similar patterns in behavior, making it difficult to distinguish which model most accurately tracks the choice process. To distinguish which model performs best, we use a numerosity task where we ask subjects to report the number of red balls in a cluser of green and red balls. Crucially, we induce biased priors and exogenous reponse times in subjects. Because of the biased prior, the predictability of subjects choices should vary depending on the exogenous response time and which sequential sampling model they are using. This allows us to distinguish which model most accurately tracks subjects' choice processes.
