summary: "According to the efficient coding hypothesis, the precision with which we observe a number or value scales with the amount of time we spend sampling information about it. We show that if consumers are aware of this, then consumers will differ in how much attention they pay to the price of an item, depending on their price elasticity of demand for that product. We propose a way in which this finding may be used to improve welfare."
