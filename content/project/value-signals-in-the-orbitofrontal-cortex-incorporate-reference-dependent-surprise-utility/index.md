slides: Value signals in the orbitofrontal cortex incorporate reference-dependent
  news utility 
url_pdf: ""
summary: Although models of reference-dependence have become quite influential
  in behavioral economics, and are capable of explaining some puzzling
  phenomena, the fundamental assumption that experienced utility depends on both
  consumption and surprise has not been tested. This project seeks to determine
  whether Koszegi-Rabin news utility preferences (Koszegi and Rabin, 2009) have a
  biologically feasible foundation. We use an fMRI experiment where we
  manipulate subjects' expectations about the probability of viewing a rewarding 
  stimulus. We look at value signals encoded
  in the orbitofrontal cortex at the time of consumption to see if these signals
  depend solely on consumption utility, or if they are also modulated by
  surprise utility. *Winner of the 2022 Chen Graduate Innovator Grant.*
